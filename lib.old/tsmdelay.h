/**
 *  This defines a function and some handy macros for time-delays
 *  The main macros take arguments in cycles, not time, but on a PIC
 *  with a 4MHz clock, one cycle nicely corresponds to one microsecond.
 *
 *  It covers the range from 13 cycles to 190,000 cycles with
 *  rather good accuracy, perhaps within 5% or so.
 *
 *  There are also macros to do so by time period, assuming
 *  KHZ is defined somewhere, but these have limits like
 *  the macros:
 *    Clock  Small Max  Big Max
 *    20MHz  150us    38000us
 *    10MHz  300us    76000us
 *    4MHz  750us    190000us
 *    1MHz  3000us    760000us
 *    100KHz  30000us    7600000us
 *    48KHz  62500us    15833333us
 *    32KHz  93750us    23750000us
 *
 *  If you exceed these, your compiler will likely warn you of an
 *  overflow.
 *
 *  Also note that, while the internal 4MHz clock is decently
 *  accurate, the internal 48Khz oscillator is very rough.  :)
 *  Had to dig out a 32.768KHz crystal oscillator to verify this
 *  worked at low speeds...
 *
 *  If you're linking several C files together that all include
 *  tsmdelay.h, INSTANTIATE_DELAY should only be defined in one of
 *  them, or your compiler will complain of duplicate symbols.
